Finished on 1/24/23
(duration of ~20 hours, but hard to say becuase I was at work and unable to work on it continually)

JS
HTML
CSS

addEventListener('click', function(e){
  console.log(e) //look for 'target'
})

.example is the class (the dot denotes that it is a class)

Learned a little about parent/child in HTML (JQuery), according to indention.
<div>
  <id>
    <h2>
    <p>

Use this as a variable of the input from the user in JS:
const value = addForm.querySelector('input[type="text"]').value;


What else do I want to do with this project?:

I want to have the input box (form) to reset when I hit submit or enter.
